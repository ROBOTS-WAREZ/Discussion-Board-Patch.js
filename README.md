# Discussion-Board-Patch.js
A browser script used to patch the discussion board.

## Usage
[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (IceCat/Iceweasel/Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chromium/Chrome).

Download it by clicking on the [DBP.user.js](https://github.com/ROBOTS-WAREZ/Discussion-Board-Patch.js/blob/master/DBP.user.js) file (to view the source code) and then click [Raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTS-WAREZ/Discussion-Board-Patch.js/master/DBP.user.js); your browser should automatically prompt you to add it to Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey. I use this technique to update the script in Greasemonkey.

Tampermonkey is untested for everything.

## Features
* Will automatically expand and mark posts as read when scrolled over.
* Hides the big white navigational toolbar from the top, making the content area larger.
* Keeps the main navigational sidebar on the screen at all times, even while it's minimised.
